# Goals of the talk

* 2020 has shown that Rust has great promise, and we are positioned to grow like never before
* Rust could be big, way bigger than we ever dreamed
    * Rust could be the default language for anything that runs at scale
    * Anything where reliability is king
* To get there, we have to focus relentlessly on the user experience
    * Whole product: not just the language, but the tooling, the libraries
    * We have to drive down the cost of adoption
* Benefit, if we get there
    * Massive influx of resources
    * Safer internet
    * Save the planet
