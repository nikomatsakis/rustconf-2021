# Goals of the talk

* 2020 has shown that Rust has great promise, and we are positioned to grow like never before
* Rust could be big, way bigger than we ever dreamed
    * Rust could be the default language for anything that runs at scale
    * Anything where reliability is king
* To get there, we have to focus relentlessly on the user experience
    * Whole product: not just the language, but the tooling, the libraries
    * We have to drive down the cost of adoption
* We need to up our game as a community
    * Need to be able to do more things at once, while staying coherent *and focused*
    * Vision docs, engagement
    * Support our contributions by engaging companies in new ways
        * Foundation
        * Teams
* Benefit, if we get there
    * Massive influx of resources
    * Safer internet
    * Save the planet

# Outline

...

* Simple equation: cost to adopt &lt; savings from Rust
* What is this cost?
* Learning curve
* Goal: Productive in Rust in 3 weeks
* How do we get there?
    * We need to **up our game**
    * Need to be **focused**
    * Need to be **creative**
* Look beyond the language
    * Look end-to-end, at the "whole cost"
    * Tooling, lessons, source of people
* Process: forming a vision
    * Understand the problem holistically
    * Envision the future you want
    * Figure out the right first step to take you in that direction and do it
* Process: forming a vision
    * loop:
        * Understand the problem holistically
        * Envision the future you want
        * Figure out the right first step to take you in that direction and do it
* Async Vision Doc
    * Trying this out for Async Rust
* Understanding the problem
    * Talked to a lot of people, a lot I didn't know
    * Troublesome patterns
         * Portability yes
         * But also cancellation, nested awaits
    * But also gaps:
        * Tooling, documentation, patterns
* Planning the future
    * "It it compiles, it works"
    * "Tooling to be envious of"
    * "Consolidated documentation that covers xxx"
* Taking our first steps
* Does this mean that we never get core improvements?
    * *New users* vs *Experienced users*
    * A real tension, but this is not a zero sum game
        * First steps for async Rust include some fundamental improvements
            * For example: type alias impl trait, generic associated types
        * The focus on ergonomics benefits everyone
* Example: Accessibility
    * Curb cuts, etc
    * But more than that.
        * It's like, in order to do the curb cuts, had to develop new core technology, which then enables all kinds of other things.
* But don't get me wrong
    * There IS tension
    * CTC
* Secret weapon: open source
    * Let customers help themselves
    * But we have to improve our ability to do that cohesively
    * Tools:
        * Initiative process
        * Creating more written guidelines and principles
        * Engaging companies to hire and support Rust contributors
