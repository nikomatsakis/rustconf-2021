# 2021

- Rust foundation launched! 🎉
- Rust teams at many major companies!! 😲

???

* Banner year for Rust
* Launched Foundation, so Rust has a stable home as it grows and moves toward sustainbility
* Speaking of sustainability, multiple teams of multiple devs!
* oh, and one other thing: linux kernel!
* representative of Rust's growing usage in the foundational pieces of the computing world
* so naturally I have a question for you all

--
- Rust in the linux kernel 🤯

---

# Is...this it?

--

Like, did we... make it?

---

# 2015

???

But let's step back a minute, to 2015, when Rust 1.0 was released

--

.center[
Rust started with the quixotic dream of delivering the

## GREAT POWER OF C++

<br/>
*without the*

## GREAT RESPONSIBILITY 

<br/>
that comes with it
]

---

# 2015

- Plan:
  - Control and performance predictability of C++
  - Feel of a high-level language like JavaScript

???

* Rust 1.0 launched 6 years ago
* The plan then was the same as it is now:
  * Can we make a systems language that gives you all the control of C++
  *

# Rust journey

1. Show it can work

--
2. Sustainability, adoption, production

--
3. ???

--
4. Profit

# "Profit?"

*Graph:* 

```
C++         Rust

        JS, Ruby, Python
```

# What does that look like?

Yes, traditional "systems programming" targets:

* Browsers
* Foundational infrastructure
* Kernel hacking

But also other domains, when used at scale:

* Websites, day-to-day business logic
* Machine learning

---

# Business logic, really?

Isn't that the prototypical case where you want to move fast?

# Our goal

## Java to Rust in 3 weeks

--

.center[.font500[.font300[😲]]]

---

# How do we get there?

--

1. Understand the problems

--

2. Think about how we want Rust to feel

--

3. Take a step in that direction

--

4. Re-evaluate and proceed
