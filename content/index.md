# Rust journey

1. Show it can work

2. Sustainability, adoption, production

--
3. ???

4. Profit

# "Profit?"

*Graph:* 

```
C++         Rust

        JS, Ruby, Python
```

# What does that look like?

Yes, traditional "systems programming" targets:

* Browsers
* Foundational infrastructure
* Kernel hacking

But also other domains, when used at scale:

* Machine learning
* Websites, day-to-day business logic
